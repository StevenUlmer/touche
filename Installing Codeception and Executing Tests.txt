Installing Codeception and Executing Tests


Install Testing Framework
Running testing_setup.sh will install the entirety of the testing framework assuming to already PHP installed to your system. After running this you can configure the tests to your liking, as explained below.






Configure Acceptance Tests
Configure this module (in acceptance.suite.yml) by setting url and browser to:


modules:
      enabled:
         - WebDriver:
            url: 'http://your_project_url/'
            browser: phantomjs




Add this to the list of enabled extensions in codeception.yml:

extensions:
   enabled:
       - Codeception\Extension\Recorder
             delete_successful: false # keep screenshots of successful tests








Launch PhantomJS before executing tests.


phantomjs --webdriver=4444


* This will most likely have to be ran in a separate terminal




Execute Acceptance Tests IMPORTANT! 
I have made a script called run_tests.sh that will execute all the tests in ORDER. One of the downsides of Codecept is that you can’t execute tests in any order unless you group the tests and run them one by one. This script will do this for you. If you add any more tests, ensure that they are placed in the proper directory and if a new directory is created that you add it to the run_tests script.




Create Acceptance Tests
To generate your acceptance tests, run the command below. Acceptance tests emulate behavior of a real user visiting your site.

./vendor/bin/codecept generate:cest acceptance path_to/proper_test_directory/TestName

Build Codeception Dependencies
If you choose to add extensions are change any of the files related to Codeception you must rebuild Codeception:


./vendor/bin/codecept build
