# Judging Cests

Judging takes the most time out of all the Cest suites.
Waiting for a submission to appear as a judge takes, at most, one minute.

This suite tests the following:
- Judging files after headers and forbidden words have been updated
- The UI for the Judge Submissions page
- Updated standings as both Judge and Team
- The auto judge
    - This Cest runs through a wide variety of files and file types in order to fully test different outcomes.
    - Because of this, it takes a while to run.
- Correct scoring on both the Judge and Team's standings
