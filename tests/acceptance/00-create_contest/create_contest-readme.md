# Create_contest Cests

Create_contest runs and tests the essentials for starting a new contest:

- Actually creating the contest
- Testing that each of the user roles can login successfully 
    - This includes changing passwords and rejecting bad login information
- Starting the contest as a Judge
- Creating a new problem as an Admin

These four functions are integral for each of the other Cests, so create_contest must be run first.
