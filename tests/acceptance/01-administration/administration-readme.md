These cests test the different aspects of editing contest details.

- Clearing a contest using the Admin's clear contest feature
- Cloning a contest using the Admin's clone contest feature
- Editing categories, problems, and teams as an Admin
- Checking the Ignore Standard Error box as an Admin and testing the results
- Recalculating Responses (as of writing, this is not yet implemented)
- Toggling team visibility to judges
